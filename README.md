# Python Slot Machine

This is a simple slot machine game built in Python. You can place bets, spin the reels, and try to win by matching symbols. The game uses fun emoji symbols like cherries, watermelons, eggplants, lemons, and stars.

I built this project to practice Python programming, working with functions, loops, and conditionals. It also demonstrates how to manage a game balance, handle user input, and calculate winnings.

**Key Features**
* Spin three reels with random symbols
* Place bets and manage your balance
* Win different payouts based on the symbol combinations
* Fun emoji-based interface for easy play

**How to Play**
* You start with a balance of £100
* Place a bet and spin the reels
* If all three symbols match, you win a payout depending on the symbol:
  * 🍒 = 3x your bet
  * 🍉 = 4x your bet
  * 🍆 = 1x your bet
  * 🍋 = 2x your bet
  * ⭐ = 10x your bet
* Your balance is updated after each spin
* The game ends if you run out of money or choose to stop playing

**Example Gameplay**
Current balance is £100  
Place your bet amount: 10

You won: £30  
Do you want to spin again?: (Y/N) Y  

This project is a fun way to practice Python programming and create a simple interactive game :3
